# Screen Grab

## Intended Purpose
To grab a user defined area of the screen repeatedly and save images for later processing.

## Why Do I Need This
Documentation on some websites is not accessible for my needs and in some cases not possible to download in an accessible format or at all!
I also prefer a record or point in time copy of materials in a format suitable for offline use in the future.

## Why Not Use Snip
It is possible to use snip but i need to extract documents with hundreds of pages, snip is too slow and I need more control over the captured area and repeatability.

## OCR ?
I have looked at doing this and the current conclusion is that it is too complex to add to this project.
The generated pdf can be OCR'd using the following :
ocrmypdf https://ocrmypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
It is not a casual installation but it is very quick once it is working.
