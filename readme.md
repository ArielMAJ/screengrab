# Screen Grab

## Intended Purpose
To grab a user defined area of the screen repeatedly and save images for later processing.

## Why Do I Need This
Documentation on some websites is not accessible for my needs and in some cases not possible to download in an accessible format or at all!
I also prefer a record or point in time copy of materials in a format suitable for offline use in the future.

## Why Not Use Snip
It is possible to use snip but i need to extract docoments with hundreds of pages, snip is too slow and I need more control over the captured area and repeatability.
